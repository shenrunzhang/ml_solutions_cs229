My own solutions to Stanford's CS 229 machine learning course problem sets, including coding projects. Here are some highlights.

## Cart-Pole Balancing

(aka Inverted Pendulum Problem)

![](https://github.com/shenrunzhang/ml_solutions_cs229/blob/main/problemset_solutions/code/cartpole_qlearning/result.gif)

This project involves using reinforcement learning to solve the inverted pendulum problem through Markov decision processes. The problem is formulated as a cart-pole system, where the objective is to balance a pole on a cart by controlling the movement of the cart. The code discretizes the state space, and solves for the optimum policy through value and policy iteration.


## Weighted Logisitic Regression
